# Bowling Scoring System Project on C language
## The project created by my team for the course at the US Embassy "Intro to programming" course in Tashkent. 
---

## Description 
* Score in bowling for more than just 1 person. This code interacts with players via console. It actually works with a huge number of players and follows all the rules of the game:
---

## Rules
* If your score in one frame is more than 10, than it warns you via specific message on the screen and then asks to write your score again.
 
* If you bowled a strike or a spare - it congratulates you and remember to add extra score. The same thing is with spares.	
 
* The 10th frame is the most interesting and the most complicated to predict. We took care of this feature and follow all the strikes/spares rules. 	
 
* Via console the program interacts with players and shows them _TOTAL SCORE OF THE GAME_ and the _WINNER_ player.

## Features
* The program is one of the most readable and easy-to-understand codes.
(UPD: the text was written long time before me applying to Univ and studying OOP, so now I'm a little shocked that I thought like this ðŸ™ƒ)

* No analogue on the Internet for C. Code is absolutely unique.
