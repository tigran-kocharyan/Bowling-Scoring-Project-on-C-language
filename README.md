# Bowling-Scoring-Project-on-C-language
Hi there! This project was created by my team out of 3 people for counting all the score in bowling for more than just 1 person. This code interacts with players via console. It actually works with a huge number of players and follows all the rules of the game:

	-If your score in one frame is more than 10, than it warns you via specific message on the screen and then asks to write your score again.
	
	-If you bowled a strike or a spare - it congratulates you and remember to add extra score.
	
	-The same thing is with spares.
	
	-The 10th frame is the most interesting and the most complicated to predict. We took care of this feature and follow all the strikes/spares rules. 
	
	-Via console our project interacts with players and shows them TOTAL SCORE OF THE GAME and the WINNER between all the players.
	
	-Eventually, this is one of the most readable and easy-to-understand codes. And moreover, we did not find any analogue on the Internet for C language. That's why, this code is unique C code.
